## {Execution}Info vs Info

There is the Info from within the execution that will wait for the execution id of the resource
There is the Info from outside the execution that will wait for the resource 

Two very different things

## Resource status vs execution status

What happen within the execution is only execution related, what happen outside of tempolite is just resource related.
